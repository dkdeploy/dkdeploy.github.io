## execute\_down

Downgrade database to a previous version
<div class="callout alert">
CAUTION: It may not be possible to downgrade cleanly. If e.g. a previous migration concatenated fields in a table, it will not be possible any longer to separate the information.

### Usage

Pass the targeting `migration_version` either as an argument (example in output section) or enter it interactively.
